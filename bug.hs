This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a list that might be empty, resulting in a runtime error. The function `head'` will throw an exception if the input list is empty.  This is a common error when dealing with potentially empty lists in Haskell, and should be avoided by using safe pattern matching or other techniques to handle the empty list case.
